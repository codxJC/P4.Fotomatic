# Off-Platform Project: Fotomatic

**Project scope: Fix a broken website**

In this project I fixed a broken version of a responsive website called Fotomatic. 
Some specs and an image were provided to help with making adjustments to the broken code.

I fixed the code and modified/added media queries to make the website responsive.

I have set the media query for mobile screens with a max screen of 450px,
and the tablet size screen from 600px to 760px.

Because some specs were missing I used the image as a guide to achieve a similar result.

This is an EXTREMELY DIFFICULT PROJECT. It took 16-20 hours of work to decipher the code.
The code intentionally included many containers the one inside the other or even one over the other,
and in many cases incorrect syntax and containers with similar names. 

The methodology that I used:
* I commented out the existing media queries
* I fixed the code for the desktop version.
* I uncommented the existing media queries and I modified the screen sizes and the code for the mobile version.
* Finally, I fixed the tablet version which also was the most difficult.
* All this with the help of Chrome Dev Tools.
* Also, I used temporary borders, it helped a lot with the layered containers.

The website looks ok for most screens, I think I have to check again the 320-450px screen, but for now I have to move on with my study
and come back later to review and clean my Code and check the Codecademy solution for comparison.

I am very proud that I came with my own solution and that I did not quit. It was SO difficult.
